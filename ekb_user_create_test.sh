# Ok this works up to this point
# I will need to add the following
# 		--add the user role
#		--block/unblock user to generate the email
#		--Add the Tac_lite SQL
#
#	UPDATE users SET DATA = (select data2 from dummytable) WHERE name = "test"
# I can use the SQL commands in Drush to do this.  Pretty awesome
# I"m falling asleep at the computer now, so I think it's bed time
